->go env GOPATH (to find go folder path in our system).
            Structure:

->go/
  ->bin
    ->(executable binaries)
  ->pkg
    ->(complied package files)
  ->src/
      ->myproject/
        ->main.go
        -> Other files


->go mod init mylearning
-> go run main.go (to run the code)
->In Go, packages are used instead of classes.
-> if you want to write executable code ,then it must belong to  main package.
-> fmt is used to print the console(System.out.println() in java to print console).

package main
import ("fmt")
// fmt is coming from pkg(package) directory
func main(){
	fmt.Println("Welcome to Go Language")
}

-> package main declares that this files belongs to main package,and it contains main function ,which is entry point for the executable program.
-> fmt.Scan reads until the firstWhite Space character , so if you want read a whole line , you might want to use buifo package's New Scanner
